# Clock-Tree-Synthesis-GUI
A Graphical User Interface for data visualization for clock tree synthesis
Authors: Jacob Baron and Scott Lerner

How to Use:
  In order to use this program, you'll need a .im file formatted correctly. For now, in order to chose the file, you'll need to rename the "filename" variable. This variable can be found immediately after the Linked List Class declaration.
  
  In addition to changing the variable name, you'll also need to change one more item-- the "padding" variable (This will not be necessary in a future release of this software). The padding variable is used to help the program determine how many nodes lack certain attributes (ie, left child, right child, original permissible region, permissible region, and distance).
  
  Refer to the comments within the code if you have any issues.
